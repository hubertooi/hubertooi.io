### Hi there, I have created this README file for your reference.

This repository consist of excel template I created for budgeting.
Feel free to like me know if you think it need further improvement

### Annual Expense Excel
Annual budget template splits your budgeting into 12 months. 

Expense will be your purchase category.

Amount will be the purchase cost.

Percentage spend is per category percentage spent divided total spending in the particular month

### Monthly Budget

This template split monthly budget in 4 different sections:
1) Essential 50%
2) Wants 20%
3) Savings 20%
4) Investing 10%

The percentage means the amount of your after tax monthly salary usage to different section

This allows you to split up the spending into those sections.

Essentials include rental, food budget, and anything you think is necessary.

Wants include shopping, entertainments and what you want to buy.

Savings include emergency funding.

Investing include anything you are investing.


Thank you and take care, everyone and enjoy!!!
